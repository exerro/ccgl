CCGL is a graphics library for ComputerCraft/CC:Tweaked.

It aims to provide simple graphics capability with additional layers supporting
advanced 2D rendering (i.e. stackable affine transformations), 3D rendering (
both raytraced and raster based) and a custom language which compiles to optimised
Lua code and seamlessly interacts with the library.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/exerro/ccgl/wiki) for documentation.
